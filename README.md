# GitHub Trending Repository Analyzer

A FastAPI application that fetches and analyzes trending repositories from GitHub for a specified programming language. It provides insights into the repositories and their relationships based on shared topics, making the data suitable for graph visualization.

## Live Deployment

Access the GitHub Trending Repository Analyzer **[here](https://github-trending-analyzer-service.onrender.com)**.

- **Root Endpoint** (`/`): Displays a welcome message to verify the service is live.
- **Trending Repositories Endpoint** (`/analyze/github/trending/{language}`): Fetches and analyzes trending repositories for a specified programming language.

---

## Features

1. **Fetch GitHub Trending Repositories**
   - Extracts repository details including:
     - Name (owner/repo)
     - Description
     - Number of stars
     - Number of forks
     - Programming language
   - Ensures proper formatting of repository names.

2. **Graph-Based JSON Output**
   - Represents repositories as nodes.
   - Includes relationships (edges) between repositories based on shared topics and semantic similarities.

3. **Caching**
   - Uses a Time-to-Live (TTL) cache to prevent redundant requests to GitHub.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Handles network issues, invalid requests, and GitHub rate limits gracefully.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the application locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kattubadimohammad/github_trending_analyzer.git
cd github_trending_analyzer

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
bash
python3 -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment:
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Application
bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
API Usage
Base URL
If running locally:

http://localhost:8000
Deployed on Render:

https://github-trending-analyzer-service.onrender.com
Endpoints
Root Endpoint
GET /

Returns a welcome message to verify the service is live.

Analyze Trending Repositories
GET /analyze/github/trending/{language}

Path Parameter:

language: The programming language to analyze (e.g., python, javascript).

Query Parameter:

repo_limit (optional): The maximum number of repositories to analyze (default: 10).

Example Requests:

bash
curl -X GET "https://github-trending-analyzer-service.onrender.com/analyze/github/trending/python"
curl -X GET "https://github-trending-analyzer-service.onrender.com/analyze/github/trending/python?repo_limit=5"
Example Response:

json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "owner1/repo1", "description": "...", "stars": 1234, "forks": 567, "language": "python"},
    {"id": "owner2/repo2", "description": "...", "stars": 876, "forks": 234, "language": "python"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"source": "owner1/repo1", "target": "owner2/repo2", "weight": 2}
  ]
}
Deployment on Render
To deploy this application on Render, follow these steps:

Create a Render Account at Render.com.

Create a New Web Service:

Connect your GitHub repository.

Set the following commands:

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000

Set the environment variable PORT to 10000.

Deploy the Service:

Monitor logs to ensure the service starts successfully.

Access the deployed app using the URL provided by Render.

How It Works
Web Scraping:

The app fetches GitHubâ€™s trending page for the given programming language using httpx.

Parses HTML with BeautifulSoup to extract repository data.

Data Analysis:

Represents repositories as nodes.

Computes relationships (edges) based on shared topics.

Graph-Based JSON Output:

Nodes: Repository details.

Edges: Connections between repositories with a weight representing shared topics or semantic similarities.

Caching:

Results are cached for one hour to minimize redundant requests.
